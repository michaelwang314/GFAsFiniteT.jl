- check memory allocations, type instabilities, and perform general optimizations
- reproduce structures from PRL
- add initialize for lattice positions
- document code and add comments
- look into Makie for visualizations
    - translate test script into working module
- allow 2D simulations
- add StaticHarmonicTrap and MovingHarmonicTrap (uses function for position)
- check if converting start_id to Vector instead of Array{, 3} is better
